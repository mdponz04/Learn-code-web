## JavaScript
- Text-based language so if you miss typing anything it cause bugs
- Should have log many things for debug purpose
- Although it is not required but you should have semi-colon at the end of each line of code because it sometime make bugs
- In .js script can get element from html using document.getElement...
  
## HTML
- Text-based too
- The string of id, class, type in div or any component is really important because it will work directly with .js script
- Be called document
